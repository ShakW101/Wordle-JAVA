## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. The game randomly selects a hidden 5-letter word.
2. You have 6 attempts to guess the word by typing in guesses into letter boxes.
3. After each guess, you will receive feedback for each letter:
    - A letter box turns GREEN if that letter is in the word and in the right spot
    - A letter box turns YELLOW if that letter is in the word but not in the right spot.
    - A letter box turns GRAY if that letter is not in the word.

Your goal is to guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts.
